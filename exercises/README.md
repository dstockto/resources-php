Exercises
=============

Each exercise lives in a self-contained directory.  Exercise directories contain at least one exercise file
and one solution file.  Some may contain an assets directory that pertain to the exercise.  There is often
more than one way to solve a problem in programming, hence it will not be unusual to discover more than
one solution file for an exercise.
